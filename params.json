You can find the original pdf version here.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simplified version (the pdf is way cooler) but will be updated in the not so distant future to give you a fancy cheating option not only for your computer but also for your mobile phone.\r\n\r\nYAML4 is a modular, code based CSS framework. First published in October 2005 the author Dirk Jesse offers with YAML a base for developing flexible layouts. Especially the work with flexible (elastic, fluid) containers and various units is made easier with YAML. YAML offers a complete set of matching building blocks which allow to easily create complex websites. Among this set are grids, navigation, forms, typography modules and all offered add-on. YAML is a device independent design. All layout modules are compatible with HTML5 and CSS3. YAML is regularly updated and third-party developers offer tutorials and templates.\r\n\r\n(Cf.: YAML4)\r\n\r\nAs YAML is obviously the perfect option to create websites with various requirements in a fast and easy way, the FAU's web building blocks is going to be changed to a YAML4 based design.\r\n\r\nTo make the work easier for developers and future users, the new CSS framework comes with a free YAML4 cheat-sheet, made by the RRZE. The users can find all important code fragments and their functions, the base code (base.css) to create a YAML4 design and various elements that YAML4 offers in a fast, easy and colorful way.\r\n\r\nThe cheat-sheet is like YAML4 under the Creative Commons Licence (3.0)\r\n\r\nHappy developing!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
