        <p>YAML4 Cheatsheet</p>

<p>This is the HTML version of the YAML4 cheatsheet. You can find the original pdf version here.</p>

<p>This is a very simplified version (the pdf is way cooler) but will be updated in the not so distant future to give you a fancy cheating option not only for your computer but also for your mobile phone.</p>

<p>YAML4 is a modular, code based CSS framework. First published in October 2005 the author Dirk Jesse offers with YAML a base for developing flexible layouts. Especially the work with flexible (elastic, fluid) containers and various units is made easier with YAML. YAML offers a complete set of matching building blocks which allow to easily create complex websites. Among this set are grids, navigation, forms, typography modules and all offered add-on. YAML is a device independent design. All layout modules are compatible with HTML5 and CSS3. YAML is regularly updated and third-party developers offer tutorials and templates.</p>

<p>(Cf.: YAML4)</p>

<p>As YAML is obviously the perfect option to create websites with various requirements in a fast and easy way, the FAU's web building blocks is going to be changed to a YAML4 based design.</p>

<p>To make the work easier for developers and future users, the new CSS framework comes with a free YAML4 cheat-sheet, made by the RRZE. The users can find all important code fragments and their functions, the base code (base.css) to create a YAML4 design and various elements that YAML4 offers in a fast, easy and colorful way.</p>

<p>The cheat-sheet is like YAML4 under the Creative Commons Licence (3.0)</p>

<p>Happy developing!</p>
